# Concept Compass

## Project Overview

Welcome to **Concept Compass**! This application is designed to help software engineers and product creators refine their app ideas through conversations with a virtual panel of AI agents. Each agent brings a unique perspective to the table, helping you either polish your idea or determine if it’s worth pursuing at all.

Originally conceived for software projects this has been generalized for any concept that requires planning and execution

## How It Works

When you present your idea in Concept Compass, you’ll enter a chat environment with multiple AI agents, each assigned a different role. Some examples might be:

- **The Facilitator:** This agent helps structure your idea by asking questions and developing a step-by-step plan as the conversation emerges. It is also responsible for controlling the flow of the conversation by desciding who needs to give their input next. This agent orchestrates the entire session. He is the host.

- **The Skeptic:** This agent challenges assumptions, questions the necessity of the idea, and highlights potential flaws.

- **The Optimist:** This agent focuses on the benefits and explores how the idea could have a positive impact and be implemented successfully.
  
- **Feasability analyst** This agent is concerned with technical and financial feasability. He will need convincing if he spots something that he doesn't think is possible or might be cost prohibitive.

- **The Architect** This agent is responsible for the overall structure of the idea

-**The Innovator** This agent would focus on creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. Whether it’s a software solution or a party theme, the Innovator suggests fresh ideas, unique twists, and innovative elements that could make the concept stand out.

-**The Audience Advocate** This agent represents the perspective of the end user or the attendees. They focus on how the final experience will feel to the people who are going to use the product or attend the event. They help ensure the idea stays user-centered and enjoyable for the actual audience.

-**The Marketer** role is all about how to present and position the idea to the outside world. Whether it’s a software product or a public event, the Marketer thinks about how to communicate its value, who the target audience is, and what kind of messaging or branding will resonate. They might outline marketing strategies, promotional channels, or key selling points to make sure the idea not only works well but also attracts attention and finds its audience.

All agents follow the same conversation thread, each offering their own insights. This collective input will help you gain a well-rounded view of your concept.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Conversation:** Interact with a panel of specialized AI agents, each with a distinct role.
- **Diverse Perspectives:** Receive feedback from different angles to refine your idea or reconsider its feasibility.
- **Evolving Dialogue:** Engage in a dynamic discussion that evolves as agents respond to each other.

## Usage

Start a session, describe your idea, and let Concept Compass guide you toward a clearer, more refined concept—or help you decide if it’s an idea worth pursuing. Once you're satisfied, you can view/download the detailed description and plan.
