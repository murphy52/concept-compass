# Concept Compass

## Project Overview

Welcome to **Concept Compass**! This application is designed to help software engineers and product creators refine their app ideas through conversations with a virtual panel of AI agents. Each agent brings a unique perspective to the table, helping you either polish your idea or determine if it’s worth pursuing at all.

## How It Works

When you present your idea in Concept Compass, you’ll enter a chat environment with multiple AI agents, each assigned a different role. Some examples might be:

- **The Planner:** This agent helps structure your idea by asking questions and developing a step-by-step plan.

- **The Skeptic:** This agent challenges assumptions, questions the necessity of the idea, and highlights potential flaws.

- **The Optimist:** This agent focuses on the benefits and explores how the idea could have a positive impact and be implemented successfully.

All agents follow the same conversation thread, each offering their own insights. This collective input will help you gain a well-rounded view of your concept.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Conversation:** Interact with a panel of specialized AI agents, each with a distinct role.
- **Diverse Perspectives:** Receive feedback from different angles to refine your idea or reconsider its feasibility.
- **Evolving Dialogue:** Engage in a dynamic discussion that evolves as agents respond to each other.

## Usage

Start a session, describe your idea, and let Concept Compass guide you toward a clearer, more refined concept—or help you decide if it’s an idea worth pursuing.
